In the modern digital landscape, the need for intelligent, secure, and scalable communication systems has grown substantially. Traditional chatbots, though helpful, are often limited by rigid rule-based logic and a lack of contextual understanding. To address this limitation, this project presents the development of an AI-powered chatbot built using Spring Boot, ReactJS, and NVIDIA LLM API. The core objective is to create a full-stack conversational platform that provides real-time, natural-language interaction with users, supported by a robust backend and intelligent frontend interface.
The system integrates a secure JWT-based authentication mechanism with role-based access control, offering both user and admin functionalities. Users can sign up with email OTP verification, chat with the AI model using natural language, and view their prompt history, while admins can review, edit, and manage all prompts across the system. The chatbot interacts with Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA through Spring AI SDK connected to the NVIDIA API, generating context-aware and coherent responses to diverse user queries. All conversation data is stored in MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that supports real-time scalability and data integrity.
The frontend is developed using ReactJS, styled with Bootstrap, and bundled using Vite, resulting in a highly responsive and user-friendly interface. Extensive testing confirms that the system performs efficiently under load, handles concurrent requests securely, and delivers real-time AI responses with low latency. This project demonstrates a modern, secure, and extensible chatbot architecture suitable for deployment in educational, commercial, and enterprise environments.
